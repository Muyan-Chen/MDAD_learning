    "### ***Collaborative Work***\n",
    "Initially, ***cooperation poses a significant challenge when individuals aim to discuss a software product***. As understood, a project involves a collective effort, with each member potentially configuring distinct features for the code. A version control system serves as a valuable tool for developers to systematically monitor all modifications made to the source code. Alongside managing changes, it meticulously records the authorship of alterations, providing transparency on who made what changes and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Version Management***\n",
    "Concluding a project with one version is impossible! A version control system facilitates the organization of multiple iterations of a project, maintaining order in the source code. It permits the establishment of ***a new branch for every developer implementing alterations in the code***, ensure that these changes are vetted (reviewed and approved) by other developers before being merged into the original code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon obtaining approval from fellow contributors, the new code seamlessly integrates with the main source, becoming the latest project version. This approach enables individuals to work on a duplicate of the project, allowing them to make edits without impacting the efforts of others. ***They can commit changes when the task is completed***. Consequently, it amplifies productivity, augments team efficiency, and minimizes the potential for errors and conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Revision Retrieval***\n",
    "Another critical aspect involves reverting to previous versions. Whether our project resides on a local machine, an external drive, or a cloud system, the necessity to consistently back up the project becomes paramount, considering the likelihood of errors or issues. Consequently, users begin saving project versions incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a version control system meticulously tracking each modification, addressing a bug in the latest version becomes more straightforward. If the updated version proves faulty, reverting to the previous version is a smoother process. In the case of Git usage, this challenge is mitigated. Accessing the last saved project version or reverting to any previous state becomes seamless. This feature proves invaluable in recovering from disasters or unforeseen circumstances."

The Sprint Review is the penultimate event of a Scrum development cycle and is time-boxed to a maximum duration of 4 hours, in the case of a 1-month Sprint, but is usually shorter. **The end result of the Review should be an updated Product Backlog and a provisional list of the items to be tackled during the next Sprint**.\n",

The items in the Sprint Backlog should correspond to the Sprint Goal, answering ‘why?’ they are there and be underpinned by an actionable plan of how they will be delivered.\n",
